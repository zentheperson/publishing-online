        <h1>Wet markets in Singapore</h1>

        <p><i>Wet markets in Singapore </i> is a data visualisation project that explores the spatial distribution of wet markets and supermarkets in relation to where people live. By understanding these two food retail options, this project explores the potential spatial reasons for the decline in popularity of wet markets. 
            <br><br> 
            The <i>storymap</i> utilises open source data from data.gov.sg and SingStat to visualise the locations of wet markets and supermarkets as the two main food retail option, against population density by planning areas. This provides insights into their accessibility for residents.
            <br><br>
            Through the <i>crowdsourced map</i>, users can contribute by reporting on the wet markets they frequent using the ushahidi platform, offering a public participation layer to the analysis.
